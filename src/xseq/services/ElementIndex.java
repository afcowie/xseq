/**
 * Construct and maintain the index for lookups between IDs and DOM Elements.
 * String IDs are the heart of the xseq system. This class builds and
 * maintains a [admittely simple] lookup table between these IDs and the DOM
 * Elements they point to.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Note that
 * 
 * <PRE>

 * doesn't work worth a damn. This seems to always return null; I poked

 * - they may be trapping an excpetion internally.
 * 
 * So, instead, we will manually implement a search care of this class, which
 * we were going to end up needing anyway.
 * 
 * At the moment there is no <I>need </I> to extend this from common Index
 * supertype, but the various Indexes do follow the same form and essentially
 * the same algorithms, so if I can abstract it I will.
