2) prerequisites and dependencies
---------------------------------

xseq depends on a number of external libraries. They are either provided by
your operating system distribution or, in some cases, are shipped alongside the
xseq sources in the lib/ subdirectory. That code is open source (or we couldn't
have redistributed it), but note that third party sources are made available
under the terms specified by their authors and as documented in the individual
licences within those files, noted below.

3) use of Java
--------------

xseq is written in the Java programming language. You have the option of
building and running xseq either using the proprietary compilers and runtime
environments are available from Sun and others, or using the libre and open
Java implementation available through GCJ and the GNU CLASSPATH project. We
welcome you to deploy xseq using either approach.
